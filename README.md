# Object-Detection

In this project I have detected object by using SIFT detector. 

SIFT - Scale Invariant Feature Transform is used for detecting features from the images and videos.

SIFT follows four steps to detect features. 
That are 
1) Scale-space extrema detection
2) Keypoint localization
3) Orientation assignment
4) Keypoint descriptor
